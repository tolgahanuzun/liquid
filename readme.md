# What is Liquid?

- It is a structure I have created for a more regular flask frame in small projects.

Considering the MVC pattern, when developing projects with flask, the Model and Controller layer is usually built in a single file in a single file. This leads to a long-line development environment that is difficult to understand. Instead, I break them into more meaningful pieces.

I usually started copying from my previous projects and starting new copy-projects. Now I want to create a main project for this. In this way, I will be able to start my projects with a more regular infrastructure.

I named this main project `liquid`.


# Todo
- Create a roadmap for the project and present it in readme.
